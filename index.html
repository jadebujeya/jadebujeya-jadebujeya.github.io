<h2>Who is Activate Youth Voice (AYV?)</h2>
<p>
We are a group of young people from rural and regional Victoria (the Loddon Campaspe Area) with a diverse range of lived experience and expertise. We are passionate about the need for greater representation and consultation of young people aged 12-25, and aim to increase the engagement of young people within both their community, and society at large. We provide an intermediary body of one or more consultants which enables organisations to engage in research, consultation, and representation more effectively on the needs, opinions, and concerns of young people, particularly for strategy, project and initiative design, implementation and evaluation.

"People who are older can sympathize with you. [Young People] can empathize with people. I think there's a big, big difference. There's a big difference between 'Oh, I'm so sorry for that', and, 'Yeah, I understand you.' Because you genuinely do."

Peer interviewing provides a safe environment where young people can feel comfortable and respected as they share their lived experiences. Our work as peer researchers has shown us that putting youth at the centre of the consultation process not only empowers them to take an active role in their community, it also removes the barriers that often prevent them from contributing fully to community decision making.

<h2>Values and Principles</h2>
<center><h3 style="color: rgb(50,30,100);">WE SEE YOUNG PEOPLE AS EXPERTS</h3></center>
<p>Young people's lived and intersecting
experiences are unique, and their voices
and views are crucial for developing
relevant, appropriate and effective
social policy and place-based projects.</p>

<center><h3 style="color: rgb(50,30,100);">PEER RESEARCH PRODUCES HIGH QUALITY DATA, INSIGHTS AND FINDINGS</h3></center>
<p>The We Hear YOUth project will ensure young
people are skilled to relevant peer research
standards. We recognise their experiential
knowledge and inside understanding of the
issues being studied can enhance the
richness and nuance of the inquiry.</p>

<center><h3 style="color: rgb(50,30,100);">WE ARE COMMITTED TO PEER
RESEARCH AS A GENUINE PROCESS
FOR CLIENT VOICE
</h3></center>
<p>The We Hear YOUth project will provide a framework
for how to involve peer researchers as part of client
voice, including in research and tool design, data
collection, analysis and reporting back findings to their
peers to
‘
close the loop
’. We will ensure peer research
is not extractive, transactional or tokenistic.</p>

<center><h3 style="color: rgb(50,30,100);">THE SAFETY AND
PROTECTION OF PEER
RESEARCHERS IS
PARAMOUNT</h3></center>
<p>We will carefully consider legal, ethical and
data issues when designing and implementing
the We Hear YOUth project, and will take
both a proactive and protective approach.
</p>

<center><h3 style="color: rgb(50,30,100);">PEER RESEARCH CREATES IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>We will evaluate the We Hear YOUth project's research
outputs, data quality, participant experience and wider
societal or policy impact, to build the evidence base and
demonstrate the value of peer research.
</p>

<center><h3 style="color: rgb(50,30,100);">YOUTH PARTICIPATION MUST BE
MEANINGFUL, AGE APPROPRIATE
AND RESPECTFUL OF DIVERSITY</h3></center>
<p>The We Hear YOUth project will consider
flexible options for participating, how to
create safer and brave spaces, and tailor the
project to the age and stage of participants.
</p>

<center><h3 style="color: rgb(50,30,100);">WE PROVIDE SUPPORT
TO OUR YOUTH
PARTICIPANTS</h3></center>
<p>Mentoring, coaching and general
support will be provided to create an
inclusive and accessible environment for
effective and meaningful participation.
</p>

<center><h3 style="color: rgb(50,30,100);">WE VALUE PEER RESEARCH (YOUTH
PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH)</h3></center>
<p>YPAR is seen as an effective, appropriate and meaningful social
research approach, with peer interviewing as one effective
qualitative data collection method within this broader
framework. The data and findings from this process
will be taken seriously, to ensure young people's
voices and views are heard and listened to.
</p>

<center><h3 style="color: rgb(50,30,100);">WE WANT TO HEAR FROM
LESS HEARD VOICES
</h3></center>
<p>Peer researchers will enable us to include the
voices and views of those who may not
otherwise have been reached in community
consultation processes. This is important for
the development of representative and
inclusive social policy and place-based
projects and initiatives.
</p>

<center><h3 style="color: rgb(50,30,100);">WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE PRINCIPLE
OF CO-BENEFIT
</h3></center>
<p>Peer research has the potential to benefit those who participate
by providing them valuable work experience and training that may
increase their employability in the future. The We Hear YOUth
project will look to provide recognition of prior learning. It will also
provide mentoring, skills building and broader
support for the youth participants in
understanding their strengths and core
competencies, and build their confidence.
