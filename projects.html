This scoping project seeks to identify the systemic barriers LGBTI+ young people face in accessing appropriate, safe and contemporary evidence-based health and wellbeing services through General Practitioners (GPs) across the Loddon Area, as well as the gaps in existing and emerging resources and training, in order to identify opportunities for change to reduce those systemic barriers and thereby increase LGBTI+ young people’s access to the care they need.

<b>Dates: 06/07/21 - Present</b>
<p>
As part of the process of reassessing their youth strategy, Bendigo City Council wanted to conduct a series of focus group sessions with young people who had taken part in their programs under the previous strategy. We were hired to conduct these focus groups, in order to provide a relatable and neutral facilitation that would enable participates to feel comfortable and contribute honestly to the space.

<b>Dates: 13/02/2021 - 28/07/2021</b>
<h4>About The Project <br><i>by Victoria University</i></h4>
<p>
Thorne Harbour Country in partnership with the Department for Families, Fairness and Housing (Loddon; DFFH) developed the We Hear YOUth program which broadly aimed to build the capacities of young people aged 12-25 in the Loddon area (Mount Alexander, City of Greater Bendigo, Central Goldfields, Campaspe, Loddon and Macedon Ranges) in research, specifically peer interviewing. The program draws on Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR), which positions young people as co-researchers, utilizing their unique skills and experiences, working together with researchers from institutions or organisations to develop and shape a research project that creates change towards issues that matter to them.
<br><br>
The program is underpinned by a commitment to the United Nations Human
Rights Commission's Convention of the Rights of the Child (Article 12) which
focuses on children and young people’s right to participate in civic life, specifically in voicing their concerns and participating in decision-making that affects them. The right to be heard is placed at the centre of this program, clearly aligning with academic literature that identifies young people as both the experts in their own lives and futures (Carlson, 2008) and as those best placed to gather and amplify a
chorus of youth voices for social change (Camarotta & Fine, 2008).
<br><br>
This place-based project was a fully subsidised course that was designed to
develop the knowledge and skills of young people so that they can form a
network of Youth Peer Interviewers (YPI) in the region. As a network of YPIs, these young people will be able to work with DFFH and other local agencies to bring together the voices of young people from diverse experiences and backgrounds to facilitate youth-informed and led change.
