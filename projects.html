<p>
As part of the process of reassessing their youth strategy, Bendigo City Council wanted to conduct a series of focus group sessions with young people who had taken part in their programs under the previous strategy. We were hired to conduct these focus groups, in order to provide a relatable and neutral facilitation that would enable participates to feel comfortable and contribute honestly to the space.

This project aimed to explore young peoplesâ€™ sense of connection to their hometowns within the Loddon and Campaspe areas. We specifically focused on their needs, both those that were and were not being met by their community, leading in to why young people aged 18-25 leave rural and regional Victoria.
