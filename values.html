<p>The We Hear YOUth project will provide a framework for how to involve peer researchers as part of client voice, including in research and tool design, data collection, analysis and reporting back findings to their
peers to‘close the loop’. We will ensure peer research is not extractive, transactional or tokenistic.</p>

</h3>
<p>Peer researchers will enable us to include the
voices and views of those who may not
otherwise have been reached in community
consultation processes. This is important for
the development of representative and
inclusive social policy and place-based
projects and initiatives.

<p>Peer research has the potential to benefit those who participate
by providing them valuable work experience and training that may
increase their employability in the future. The We Hear YOUth
project will look to provide recognition of prior learning. It will also
provide mentoring, skills building and broader
support for the youth participants in
understanding their strengths and core
competencies, and build their confidence.
